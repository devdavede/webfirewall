See https://devdave.de/d0822dd2-e9af-4dcf-a62d-8d8e28aa8128 for a description (German).
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! You need to modify this code and do some other preparations (e.g. modifying your webserver config).
I also use a custom Database Class for doing Queries. You need to modify the code to use your own class or PDO.
